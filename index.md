## About Me

I'm Madeleine, and I'm very excited about researching this summer at Stanford with Dr. Maneesh Agrawala. I'll be graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in December 2020 with a major in Cognitive Science and minors in Computer Science and French. In Computer Science, I am most interested in HCI and Computer Vision. Last summer, I researched under Dr. Jessica Hullman at Northewestern, focusing on interactive and Bayesian data visualizations. This summer, I am excited to learn more in depth about current research topics in HCI  and Computer Vision.
