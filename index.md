## About Me

I'm Madeleine, and I'm very excited about researching this summer at Stanford with Dr. Maneesh Agrawala. I'll be graduating from the University of Pennsylvania in December 2020 with a major in Cognitive Science and minors in Computer Science and French. In Computer Science, I am most interested in HCI and Computer Vision. Last summer, I researched under Dr. Jessica Hullman at Northewestern, focusing on interactive and Bayesian data visualizations. This summer, I am excited to learn more in depth about current research topics in HCI  and Computer Vision. You can contact me at mgrund@sas.upenn.edu.

## About My Mentor

Maneesh Agrawala's research applies a cognitive understanding of humans to better design audio and visual media. He is a Forest Baskett Professor in the Computer Science department, and the Director of Stanford's Brown Institute for Media Innovation. You can see more of his research at http://graphics.stanford.edu/~maneesh/.

## About My Project

In recent years, the Visual Question Answering task has drawn a lot of attention as a challenging task on which to judge a model's higher level reasoning ability. However, the vast majority of datasets and models address question answering in images, not videos. Question answering about videos is difficult because they contain so much information. To compesate, previous models have used subtitles from movies, or focused on short clips of video. My project will explore asking questions about longer (30-90 second) videos. We hope to contribute in two main ways. First, we will automatically generate a dataset of compositional questions about video from scene graphs, using a similar approach as GQA (Hudson and Manning, 2019). Compositional questions are composed of several subquestions. For example, "What did the person put down before eating" first requires finding when the person began eating, looking before that time, finding when they put something down, and inquiring what the type of object. The second part of our project will use these subquestions to define the modules of a modular neural network. We hypothesize that modular neural network will be more interpretable and more effective at answering compositional questions than previous models.
